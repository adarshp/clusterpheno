class SignificanceCalculator:
    """ Class to calculate significance for a simple counting experiment.

    Example
    -------
    If, after cuts, we have the following events left over (for a given 
    luminosity) :

    - Signal : 10 events
    - Background 1 : 20 events ; tau_1 = 0.5
    - Background 2 : 13 events ; tau_2 = 1.5
    - Background 3 : 15 events ; tau_3 = 8

    Associated with each background is a factor 'tau', which parameterizes the
    uncertainty from the number of Monte Carlo events generated. For example,
    if we have the following:

    - :math:`n_{M}C` = Number of Monte Carlo events generated for a background.
    - :math:`\sigma_b` = Cross-section for the background (output by the generator).
    - :math:`\mathcal{L}` = Luminosity for which we would like to calculate the significance.

    the factor tau for this background would be:

    .. math::
        \\tau = n_{MC}/(\sigma_b * \mathcal{L})

    Basically, the more Monte Carlo events you generate, that is, the greater
    the tau factor is, the more confident you can be that the number of 
    background events that you get after cuts will match what is seen at a detector.

    Here is a minimal working program that implements the above::
    
        from SignificanceCalculator import SignificanceCalculator

        s = 10
        b_tau_tuples = [(20, 0.5), (13, 1.5), (15, 8)]
        calc = SignificanceCalculator(s, b_tau_tuples)
        calc.print_report()
    
    This should return the following::
     
        $ The expected discovery significance is 0.612969
        $ The expected exclusion limit is 1.08637
        $ S/sqrt(B) = 1.56
